	<h1>Emily Barker - No. 5 Hurricane<h1>
	
	<p>I remember when the shadows moved across your skin 
	And life was in our veins like a number five hurricane 
	I, I miss our words down the wire every day 
	And it’s true, I was never smart, with love from the start </p>
	
	<p>I got new arms to hold me, new rules to break 
	A new way of digging the most beautiful grave 
	Old bones to shake me back down to the ground 
	I got new arms to hold me now you’re not around</p>
