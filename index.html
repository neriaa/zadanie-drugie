	</div>
	<div class="text">
		<p>I remember when the shadows moved across your skin
		<br>And life was in our veins like a number five hurricane 
		<br>I, I miss our words down the wire every day 
		<br>And it’s true, I was never smart, with love from the start </p>
		
		<p>I got new arms to hold me, new rules to break 
		<br>A new way of digging the most beautiful grave 
		<br>Old bones to shake me back down to the ground 
		<br>I got new arms to hold me now you’re not around</p> 

		<p>Maybe I was wrong, maybe you were right all along 
		<br>With our patterns and our scars we turned ourselves into a work of art 
		<br>But I, I still hold a flame, it brings me warmth, it brings me pain 
		<br>And it’s true, I guess you were right, I was never smart with love, never s<br>smart with love</p>
